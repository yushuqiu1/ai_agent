# Key Challenges of Federated Learning

1. **Client Heterogeneity**: Variability in client data and computing power can complicate training.
2. **Stragglers**: Delays from slower clients can hinder overall performance.
3. **Privacy Guarantees**: Ensuring robust privacy in model updates.
4. **Unreliable Connectivity**: Issues in network stability can affect training consistency.
