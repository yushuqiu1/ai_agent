# Federated Learning Overview

- **Definition**: Enables clients to train locally and share only model updates.
- **Model Aggregation**: FedAvg uses multiple local SGD steps before averaging to reduce communication.

# Benefits

- **Privacy**: Protects client data by processing information locally.
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Minimizes data transfer by only sharing model updates.
- **Edge Computing**: Leverages local computation resources.

# Challenges

- **Client Heterogeneity**: Variability in client data and computing power can complicate training.
- **Stragglers**: Delays from slower clients can hinder overall performance.
- **Privacy Guarantees**: Ensuring robust privacy in model updates.
- **Unreliable Connectivity**: Issues in network stability can affect training consistency.

# Action Items

- Explore solutions for client heterogeneity and stragglers.
- Implement stronger privacy measures and enhance communication protocols.
